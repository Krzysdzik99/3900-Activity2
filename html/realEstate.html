<h3> ABITA PROPERTIES</h3>
<p>
    Chris founded Abita Properties in March 2022, when he became the owner and property manager of a residential income property in Council Bluffs.
    The property consists of 4 apartments. Two of them are 2 bedroom, 1-bathroom apartments, which Chris has modernized over the last year.
    The other two apartments are 3 bedroom, 1-bathroom apartments. One of the 3-bedroom apartments was completely renovated over the last year when a resident decide to
    move to a different state.

    repair in which he ran drains underground to the street from the eves of the roof. Additionally, Chris has modernized the HVAC coils and condensers to provide
    his residents with the upmost care and service. Finally, the rear decking has been replaced

<H3>WANT TO INVEST IN PROPERTY?</H3>
<P>
    If you want to invest in your own residential real estate property, you have to be sure you do the right research. It is imperative to speak
    with an accountant, an attorney, and a broker to make sure you understand the purchase process, the legal implications, and the financial implications.
    Additionally, it is highly recommended you have surplus of liquid assets to finance any large repairs that need to occur on the property. Though sad,
    many investors choose to as little money into their investment as possible. This is results in property degradation and at times a worse tax situation.
    This is why having the right team behind you is so important. Consider reaching out to Chris via LinkedOn on the 'Resume' tab if need some help getting started.
    You, too, can be a great investor!
