# 3900-Activity2
This is an assignment to be completed for my UNO ISQA 3900 class.
As of 5/26/23, this project is completed.
It is composed of 3 HTML pages, 2 Javascript files, and 1 CSS file

HTML Page 1: HOME PAGE
The home page is linked to the main.css page and the two javascripts.
It the landing page the user is brought to and serves the purpose of informing the user of who Chris Dzikowski is.
One javascript file is controlling the the photos slides and its associated navigation. This file is called slideshow.js. This file controls the display of 3 different image files.

NOTE:
The other javascript file called main.js is to control the stickiness of the navigation bar. There is an outstanding bug here, but it 
does not impact user experience or is required by the project. At a future this bug can be resolved with the javascript since project is just being
evaluated on HTML and CSS

HTML Page 2: RESUME
The resume page is linked to the main.css page. It is also linked to the main.js script and is subject to the note on line 11.
The main purpose of this page is to imform the user of Chris's resume and social links.
The resume is displayed in an Iframe looking at a document in onedrive and may need to be updated over time.

HTML Page 3: Real Esate
The resume page is linked to the main.css page. It is also linked to the main.js script and is subject to the note on line 11.
The main purpose of the page is to talk about real estate ventures Chris is involved in and how others can get involved to.
There is one image associated with with this page.
